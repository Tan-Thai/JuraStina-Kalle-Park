Sn책la-Kalle cross checks pricing of a tour on a new vs an old account
    [Tags]    Daniel    Tan_refactor
    [Documentation]    Assures that there is no "first-time-visitor-discount", despite the rumours
    Given Sn책la-Kalle has an existing account and is logged in to a new account "St책la-Nalle"
    When User checks the price on both accounts of a regular ticket and a herbivore tour
    Then The price of both purchases should match each other
